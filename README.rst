pymining - A collection of data mining algorithms in Python
===========================================================

pymining is a small collection of data mining algorithms implemented in Python.
I did not design any of the algorithms, but I use them in my own research so I
thought other developers might be interested to use them as well.

I started this small project because I could not find data mining algorithms
that were easily accessible in Python. Moreover, the libraries I am aware of
often include old algorithms that have been surpassed by newer ones.

Requirements
------------

pymining has been tested with Python 2.7 and 3.2.
